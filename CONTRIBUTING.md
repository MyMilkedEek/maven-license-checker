Thanks for thinking about contributing. For that alone, I love you.

I only accept code through pull requests.

A pull request should have the following before I consider adding your pull request:
- compilable code :: if it doesn't compile, it's not getting merged
- tests :: try to include at least one test for the feature, fix, or improvement you'd like to add
- documentation :: either through obvious naming schemes or through comments, either way is fine

If you don't care for these, there's a fork button on top that lets you do your own thing. This project is MIT licensed, so you're free to do so if you don't want to abide by my guidelines.
